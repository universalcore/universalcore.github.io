Universal Core
--------------

With over 7 billion active mobile phone connections on the planet,
a large proportion of the worldâ€™s population still lives without
access to essential information.

Several resources have been launched successfully over the last
few years proving that information can be delivered at scale at very
low cost to the end user.

Projects such as [MAMA](http://askmama.mobi), [UReport](http://ureport.ug),
[Facebook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Zero) and
[Wikipedia Zero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Zero) have
demonstrated that complex, life-enhancing information can be structured
to be accessible on low-end handsets without data capability.

The Goal
--------

Provide essential, life-enhancing information for free in low resource
settings, while strengthening the capacity of development partners
(MDAs, NGOs) to effectively and efficiently deliver social development
content through an existing location-appropriate, scalable, mobile
technology infrastructure.
